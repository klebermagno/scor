The [Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR)](http://www.apics.org/sites/apics-supply-chain-council/frameworks/scor) is a cross-industry approach to lay the groundwork for more efficient and effective information ex- change in supply networks.
SCORVoc is an OWL vocabulary which fully formalizes the latest SCOR standard, while overcoming identified limitations of existing formalizations.
